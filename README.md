## Day 9 
09-11-2021 | **Monochrome** | A monochromic image is composed of one color (or values of one color). So for example black and white maps are valid here. [See some inspiration from the great monochrome mapping competition](https://somethingaboutmaps.wordpress.com/monocarto-2019-winners/) (although those masterpieces took a bit more than a day to make, probably)
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 10 
10-11-2021 | **Raster** | Nothing stops you from doing almost all of the maps with raster data. But this day is dedicated to those lovely pixels
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 11 
11-11-2021 | **3D** | The magnificent third dimension! Visualize something in 3D
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 12 
12-11-2021 | **Population** | That is you and me. Or maybe animal population from [Movebank.org](https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main)? Anyhow a classic theme for thematic maps
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day13 13-11-2021 | **Data challenge 2: Natural Earth** | Great public domain map dataset for cartography on global and national scales. You can use Natural Earth as a part of your map or as the main source. You can download the data from a few different locations, but probably the easiest access is via [GitHub](https://github.com/nvkelso/natural-earth-vector/tree/master/geojson) or the [Natural Earth homepage](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/)
![png](dayx_x/x.png)    

## Day 14 
14-11-2021 | **Map with a new tool** | As the whole #30DayMapChallenge is much about learning and experimenting, this day is dedicated to exploring new tools. See the list on this repo below or find something interesting yourself!
![png](dayx_x/x.png)

## Day 15
15-11-2021 | **Map made without using a computer** | Title speaks for itself. Use pen & paper, [carrots](https://twitter.com/lacxrx/status/1326763865460367361?s=20) or something else
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 16 
16-11-2021 | **Urban/rural** | Map an urban area or rural area. Or something that defines that place
![png](dayx_x/x.png)   

## Day 17 
17-11-2021 | **Land** | Land, landcover, landuse... You choose
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 18 
18-11-2021 | **Water** | Oceans, lakes, rivers or something completely different
![png](dayx_x/x.png)

![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 20 
20-11-2021 | **Movement** | Visualizing movement can be done with a static map or with an animation. I [have written a blog post](https://www.gispo.fi/en/open-software/geogiffery-in-2020-with-qgis-temporal-controller/)recently on how to make animations with QGIS 
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 21 
21-11-2021 | **Elevation** | Sweet hillshades, beautiful contours, high mountains or low valleys.  DEM, DSM or something else
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 22 
22-11-2021 | **Boundaries** | Boundaries are all around us. Some of them are visible and some of them are in our heads
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 23 
23-11-2021 | **Data challenge 3: GHSL Global Human Settlement Layer**| The third data challenge should be created using this great dataset by EC JRC on human population. You can find it [here](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). Different resolutions and areas you can choose from
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 24 
24-11-2021 | **Historical map** | Historical data, historical style or something else
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 25 
25-11-2021 | **Interactive map** | What if the user wants to click, pan and explore your map? If you don't feel comfortable with programming, one easy way is to use [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) plugin. Or try out for example [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/) or [Unfolded Studio](https://studio.unfolded.ai/home)
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 26 
26-11-2021 | **Choropleth map** | A choropleth map is a type of thematic map in which a set of pre-defined areas is colored or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable that represents an aggregate summary of a geographic characteristic within each area, such as population density or per-capita income. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map))
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 27 
27-11-2021 | **Heatmap** | A heat map (or heatmap) is a data visualization technique that shows magnitude of a phenomenon as color in two dimensions. The variation in color may be by hue or intensity, giving obvious visual cues to the reader about how the phenomenon is clustered or varies over space. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map))
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 28 
28-11-2021 | **The Earth is not flat** | The Earth isn‚Äôt flat (AFAIK), so how would you show that on a map? Maybe something creative with projections? You can use e.g. [this QGIS plugin.](https://github.com/GispoCoding/GlobeBuilder)
![png](dayx_x/x.png)     

## Day 29 
29-11-2021 | **NULL** 
![png](dayx_x/x.png)            

## Day 30 
30-11-2021 | **Metamapping day** | Final day! Spend the day either by 1) collecting your entries from the challenge to a common gallery, 2) writing a tutorial or a blog post on one of your maps or 3) create a map from a theme you have chosen yourself

## Tools üî®üîß

Because the challenge is aimed to be open for everyone, the tools listed here will be *open source tools*. Still, **the challenge can be done with any kind of software** (or even without any software). Programming skills are not in any way a requirement to do the maps.

 - [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/)
	 - A Free and Open Source Geographic Information System. A desktop software that allows you to read/write multiple data formats and output (mainly static) maps.
 - [Kepler](https://kepler.gl/)
	 - Open source geospatial analysis tool for large-scale data sets and for interactive maps.
 - [Aerialod](https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod)
	 - Not really a GIS tool, but can be used to create some stunning 3D visualizations
 - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
	 - Free and open source 3D creation suite. Check out the BlenderGIS extension.
 - [R packages for geospatial](https://www.r-project.org/)
	 - [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html), [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [tmap](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) and [rayshader](https://www.rayshader.com/) to mention few examples.
 - [Mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org)
	 - Useful for geospatial data processing in the browser such as file format conversion, map projection, feature simplification, filtering, clipping, merging etc. Can also be run [locally from the command line](https://github.com/mbloch/mapshaper).
 - [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
	 - Declarative visualization specification including [cartographic output](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/#maps-geographic-displays). Specifications can be written directly in JSON or via program language interfaces such as [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) (Python) and [elm-vegalite](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vegalite/latest/VegaLite) (Elm). See, for example, this tutorial on using [OpenStreetMap with elm-vegalite](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis/blob/master/documents/tutorials/geoTutorials/openstreetmap.md)
 - [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)
	 - More flexible but lower-level declarative visualization specification including cartographic output. Specifications can be written directly in JSON or via program language interfaces such [elm-vega](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/gicentre/elm-vega/latest/).
 - [Litvis](https://github.com/gicentre/litvis)
	 - Literate Visualization notebook environment optimised for specifying visualizations and documenting the design process. While not specific to cartography, can be a useful environment for exploring cartographic design.
 - [Observable](https://observablehq.com)
	 - Reactive notebook environment for generation of visualization and cartographic output embedded in a textual narrative. Focus is on using [d3](https://d3js.org) for specifying visual output.

## Maps, stats and results
In 2020 more than 1000 people posted more than 7000 maps for the challenge on different platforms.

[#30DayMapChallenge bot by Haifeng Niu harvested comprehensive stats and maps from the challenge](https://github.com/hn303/30DayMapChallenge-Bot)   

Check the [30DayMapChallenge2020Metadata repository](https://github.com/dakvid/30DayMapChallenge2020Metadata) by David Friggens and give your contribution there. The aim there is to create an interactive gallery of the results.


## Code of Conduct

- All maps you publish have to be **your original work**. Don‚Äôt steal content from others.
- Give **credit to the original data source** whenever possible.
- The challenge is all about **creativity, openness and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography.** It is not a competition,
- **Don‚Äôt be an asshole**.
