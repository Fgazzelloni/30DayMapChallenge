## Overview

Accessibility is about **how easily people can reach essential services** — from hospitals and schools to green spaces and transport.  
In this challenge, we visualise **travel time to the nearest healthcare facility** across European regions, showcasing how geography shapes health opportunities.

The map combines population data with spatial travel-time models, illustrating areas with **limited access** and identifying **urban-rural disparities**.

## Method

Data come from the [Global Human Settlement (GHS)](https://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) and [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org/) datasets, integrated with OpenStreetMap road networks.  
Travel time is calculated using a raster-based cost-distance algorithm:

1. **Define origin points**: centroids of populated grid cells.  
2. **Assign friction surface**: speed based on road type and terrain.  
3. **Compute least-cost path** to the nearest healthcare facility.  
4. **Aggregate and visualise** results by country or region.

## Interpretation

The resulting accessibility map shows striking contrasts:
- **Urban cores** exhibit the shortest travel times (often under 15 minutes).
- **Peripheral and mountain areas** may require **over an hour** to reach care.
- These inequalities persist even in countries with universal healthcare systems.

Such spatial disparities are crucial to understanding **health equity**, informing decisions on infrastructure investment and service allocation.

## Reflection

For Day 7, the focus is not only on visual beauty but also on **inclusion** — ensuring maps represent accessibility for everyone, regardless of location or mobility.  
Think of it as **mapping fairness**: identifying who is closer, and who is left behind.

# Day 7: Accessibility — #30DayMapChallenge 2025

# 1. Get country boundaries (Europe)
europe <- ne_countries(continent = "Europe", returnclass = "sf")

# 2. Select a country
spain <- europe %>% filter(admin %in% c("Spain"))

# 3. Download hospitals from OpenStreetMap
spain %>%
  st_bbox() %>%
  st_as_sfc() %>%
  st_transform(crs = 4326) -> spain_bbox

q <- opq(bbox = spain_bbox) %>%
  add_osm_feature(key = "amenity", value = "hospital")
```


```{r}
options(timeout = 6000)
hospitals <- osmdata_sf(q)$osm_points %>%
  st_transform(crs = st_crs(spain))
# saveRDS(hospitals, "data/hospitals_spain.rds")
```


```{r}
# 4. Create a population raster (using WorldPop or synthetic grid)
# For demonstration, we’ll create a grid and simulate population
r <- rast(spain, res = 0.25) # coarse grid (~25km)
values(r) <- runif(ncell(r), min = 0, max = 1000)

```{r}
# 5. Compute distance (proxy for travel time)
# Euclidean distance in km as a simplified accessibility measure
hospitals_vect <- vect(hospitals)
dist_rast <- distance(r, y = hospitals_vect) / 1000  # convert m to km
```

```{r}
